## 🚀 Pro Tips for Best Recognition
1. **Steady Hand**: Hold your gesture for about 1 second so the AI can stabilize the prediction.
2. **The 2-Second Rule**: Lower your hand completely for **2 seconds** to tell the AI you have finished your sentence. It will then speak the entire sentence out loud.
3. **Avoid Background Clutter**: Try to have a relatively plain background so the AI doesn't get confused by other objects.
4. **Mirror Mode**: The camera is mirrored (like a real mirror). Use your hand naturally; the AI is programmed to handle both left and right hands.
